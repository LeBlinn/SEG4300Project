# Battery Type Classifier using a pre-trained CNN - SEG4300 Project
I am currently using resnet18 and getting promising results.
My dataset is very small, so I am working on improving it.


## Steps to run
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A big portion of my dataset comes from the repository [Singapore_Battery_Dataset](https://github.com/FriedrichZhao/Singapore_Battery_Dataset)
